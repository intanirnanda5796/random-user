1. class Car {
  constructor(name) {
this.name;
   }
    getDetail() {
        console.log(‘nama mobil: ’ + this.name);
   }
}


var car = new Car(‘avanza’);
car.getDetail() //it will be nama mobil: avanza


this keyword means it can be accessed global in a class
New keyword means we create new object and we can call function
   2. In my opinion, new class syntax is a template to create an object and we can access the object inside class. How to create instance class method, its refers the answer no 1, in the var car = new Car(‘avanza’), variable car is instance class method.
   3. class Bank() {
   constructor(name, nameAccount) {
      this.name = name;
      this.nameAccount = nameAccount;
   }


    getDetail() {
       console.log(‘nama bank: ’ + this.name + ‘ nama account:  ’ + this.nameAccount);
    }
}


class BankAccount extends Bank() {
    constructor(name, nameAccount) {
       super(name, nameAccount);
   }


   getAmount() {
       console.log(‘jumlah tabungan 1000000’);
   }
   
} 


var bankAccount = new BankAccount(‘BCA’, ‘nana’);
bankAccount.getDetail();
bankAccount.getAmount();


   4. Refactoring from es5 application to es2015, first thing first i would to check the variable is there any variable using var, if there is variable still using var, i will change to let. And then, maybe i would go change using classes or functional using import and export. 
   5. Because module pattern code basic is like this:
(function () {
    // declare private variable or function
   return (
        // declare  public variable or function
    )
})();
so i will go with one folder and the contents of that folder is several file is using module pattern, and in another folder we can use import / require to call that.
   6. Preferred ways to testing web applications is if that using API if the team not implementing testing like using jest, mocha, etc, i will go using postman or insomnia client
   7. web server i use is for now using apache. pros: i think its suite to beginner when using first time linux or mac. Cons: i think in apache there is no load balancer like in nginx
   8. Preferred production development process i think if in team still not using ci / cd, i will go make several branch like master, pre-production, staging, development. So if we want to up production, we must try it in pre production before to master. If in pre production there is no problem, so we can merge to master
